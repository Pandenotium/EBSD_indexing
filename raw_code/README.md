## Directions of the raw codes

----
This directory contains codes which are related with the interpretation of the CNN model.

To use them, you need only clone the codes and run.

However, comments are missing, and the codes are not organised. To understand their functions may be confusing. You may refer to the organized codes in another directory.

Log:
