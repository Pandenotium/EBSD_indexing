#Directions of the raw codes

This directory contains codes which are related with the interpretation of the CNN model.

To use them, you need only clone the codes and run.

However, comments are missing, and the codes are not organised. To understand their functions may be confusing. You may refer to the organized codes in another directory.

(To 2021/7/22, the data sets are missing so the codes cannot run normally)

##Log

2021/7/20 The directory is built. The testing data set is still missing. Users may not run the codes normally.

2021/7/21 A README file is added.
