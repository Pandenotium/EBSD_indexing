# Directions to the data sets

This directory contains the data that our model needs.

However, as Github cannot store big files, the model parameters, which is about 3 GB 
large, will not be uploaded here. To find those files, please refer to
https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5151227.

All the 4 files should be copied to the same direction as `model.py`.

## Introductions to the files

`highlin.h5` (to be removed) contains some EBSD patterns for test.
