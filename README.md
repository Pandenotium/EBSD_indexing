# EBSD_indexing

This README file contributes to the paper: Indexation and calibration of EBSD by convolutional neural networks

This project consists of these directories: 
1. raw_code, which contains the unorganised codes of the project
2. packaged_code, in which the codes are organised.

## Log

2021/7/19
Created a python file which contains the CNN model.

2021/7/20
Created two directories and copied the raw code files into this project.

2021/7/21
Tried to add the data sets but failed because of the size of the files. Add a README file to raw codes.
A test code is created. Missing the model but the rest is fine.

2021/7/22
A README file is created with organized codes. Data are stored in a new
directory. Heatmaps are done.
